# Data-driven simulation and analysis of transportation networks in Bangladesh

# Workspace Summary

This repository contains a series of assignments for data-driven simulation and analysis of transportation networks in Bangladesh from the course **EPA133A Advanced Simulation** at TU Delft. Each assignment is organized in its own directory with data, code, notebooks, and documentation.

## Structure

- **A1-Data Quality Issues for Data-Driven Simulation/**  
  Data cleaning and preprocessing of roads and bridges, including scripts, notebooks, raw/processed data, and reports.

- **A2-Building Components for Data-Driven Simulation/**  
  Agent-based simulation using Mesa to study travel times under different infrastructure scenarios. Includes model code, scenario experiments, visualization, data, and results.

- **A3-Network Model Generation/**  
  Automated generation of transport network models from data. Contains model code, scenario experiments, data, analysis notebooks, and reports.

- **A4-Network Analysis/**  
  Vulnerability and criticality analysis of infrastructure (e.g., bridges) using simulation and network-based approaches. Includes data, models, analysis notebooks, and reports.

- **assignments and rubrics/**  
  Contains assignment descriptions and grading rubrics.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and quality assessment for transport infrastructure.
- Agent-based simulation of vehicle travel times under various scenarios.
- Automated network model generation from structured data.
- Scenario-based experiments and result visualization.
- Comprehensive documentation and reports for each assignment.

## Getting Started

Each assignment folder contains a README with instructions for running the code, required inputs, and interpreting outputs. Start with the README in each subfolder for assignment-specific guidance.
