# abm-transportation-network-bangladesh

This repository contains the work for a series of assignments focused on data-driven simulation of transportation networks in Bangladesh. The structure is organized by assignment, each with its own data, code, and documentation.

## Structure

- **A1-Data Quality Issues for Data-Driven Simulation/**
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing scripts and notebooks.
  - Raw and processed infrastructure data (roads and bridges).
  - Notebooks for cleaning roads and bridges data.
  - Final cleaned datasets and a report.

- **A2-Building Components for Data-Driven Simulation/**
  - Agent-based simulation model using Mesa.
  - Scripts and notebooks for model creation, running scenarios, and visualization.
  - Raw and processed data for model input.
  - Experiment results for multiple scenarios.
  - Visualization scripts and output images.
  - Report and requirements.

- **A3-Network Model Generation/**
  - Automated generation of transport network models from data.
  - Model code, scenario experiments, and visualization tools.
  - Data files for model generation and simulation results.
  - Notebooks for data preparation and analysis.
  - Output images and summary CSVs.
  - Report and requirements.

- **A4-Network Analysis/**
  - Placeholder for further network analysis (contains data directory).

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and quality assessment for transport infrastructure.
- Agent-based simulation of vehicle travel times under different infrastructure scenarios.
- Automated model generation from structured data.
- Scenario-based experiments and result visualization.
- Comprehensive documentation and reports for each assignment.

## Getting Started

Each assignment folder contains its own README with detailed instructions for running the code, required inputs, and interpreting outputs. Start with the README in each subfolder for assignment-specific guidance.
